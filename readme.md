IMM
========

[ ![Codeship Status for sporto/imm](https://www.codeship.io/projects/c6ea6970-2eac-0132-d151-0605b547a2e8/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/39398)

Immutable data collections build on top of [immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js)

Immutable.js is great, but it doesn't have an API that feels right for CRUD applications. Eversame wraps immutable.js to provide a familiar API.
All collections returned by Eversame are immutable as well.
